The Google OAuth Client Library for Java is designed to work with any OAuth service on the web, not just with Google APIs. So far we only have one sample, but we hope to add more over time. We also welcome contributions for samples for other APIs, as described in our guide to [becoming a contributor](BecomingAContributor.md).
